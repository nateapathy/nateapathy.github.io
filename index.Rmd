I'm a postdoctoral fellow in health services research at the Perelman School of Medicine and an associate fellow at the [Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics](https://ldi.upenn.edu/fellows/fellows-directory/nate-c-apathy-phd/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm also an Affiliated Research Scientist at the [Regenstrief Institute](https://www.regenstrief.org/) in Indianapolis, Indiana. I hold a PhD in Health Policy & Management from the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at Indiana University.

My research sits at the intersection of health services research, health policy, and health informatics. I study the role of health information technology in support of delivery and payment reform efforts; the impact of regulations on innovation, adoption, and use; and the use of system-generated log data to increase understanding of health IT's impact on care quality. You can find my published work in *Health Affairs*, the *American Journal of Managed Care*, *Journal of General Internal Medicine*, the *Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association*, *Healthcare*, and *JAMA Network Open*.
